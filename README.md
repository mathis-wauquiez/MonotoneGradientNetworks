# Monotone Gradient Networks

Code by [Mathis Wauquiez](https://mathis-wauquiez.github.io) and [FÃ©lix Fourreau](https://github.com/pikoglu).\
This is our implementation for [Monotone Gradient Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10862). We implement them and study their application to the following tasks:

- Gradient Field Learning
- Color Adaptation
