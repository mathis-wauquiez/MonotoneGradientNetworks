# Monotone Gradient Networks

Code by [Mathis Wauquiez](mathis-wauquiez.github.io) and [FÃ©lix Fourreau](github.com/pikoglu)
This is our implementation for [Monotone Gradient Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10862). We implement them and study their application to the following tasks:

- Gradient Field Learning
- Color Adaptation
